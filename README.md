## 🔍 Insights


1. The average estimated salary does not significantly impact customer credit scores.  
2. The duration of the customer’s relationship with the bank has little effect on credit score.  
3. Active and inactive users are nearly equally distributed, indicating many customers do not use bank services regularly.  
4. Most customers are middle-aged (around 37), with anomalies observed among older clients.  
5. No significant differences in credit score between balance level groups (basic, middle, premium).  
6. High customer churn is observed in the middle and premium segments.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Collect real income data to better assess customers' financial capacity.  
- Expand the dataset to discover stronger predictors of credit score.  
- Launch marketing campaigns and offer additional services to engage inactive users.  
- Improve the mobile app and introduce a bonus program to attract younger customers (18+).  
- Analyze churn and implement loyalty programs to retain middle and premium customers.  
- Enhance services for middle and premium clients — such as upgraded cards, rewards, and partnerships — to boost engagement and reduce churn.
